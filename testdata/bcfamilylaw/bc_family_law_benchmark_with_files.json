I am the Claimant in this proceeding and have personal knowledge of the matters deposed to in this Affidavit, except where stated to be based on information and belief.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n2. The Respondent David Foster (\"David\") and I were married on June 18, 2016 in Kelowna, BC. We separated on August 5, 2024.\n\n3. We have one child together, Olivia Foster, born April 22, 2021. Olivia is currently 3 years old.\n\n4. During our marriage, I was Olivia's primary caregiver. I reduced my work hours to part-time (20 hours per week) after Olivia was born to care for her. David continued working full-time as a commercial pilot for WestJet.\n\nCURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n5. Since our separation, David has been exercising parenting time every other weekend from Saturday morning to Sunday evening. This arrangement was informal and not pursuant to any court order.\n\n6. On October 15, 2024, David informed me that he intends to seek a 50/50 parenting arrangement. I am opposed to this proposal for the following reasons:\n\n   (a) Olivia has been in my primary care since birth. A sudden change to equal parenting time would be disruptive to her routine and emotional wellbeing.\n\n   (b) David's work schedule as a pilot is unpredictable. He is frequently away for 3-5 days at a time. Attached as Exhibit \"A\" is a copy of his flight schedule for September and October 2024, showing 14 days away in September and 12 days away in October.\n\n   (c) David has not demonstrated he can manage Olivia's care independently. On September 28, 2024, when David had Olivia for the weekend, he left her with his mother without informing me. I only discovered this when I called to speak with Olivia.\n\n   (d) David has not attended any of Olivia's medical appointments since our separation. Attached as Exhibit \"B\" is a list of appointments I have taken Olivia to since August 2024.\n\nOLIVIA'S BEST INTERESTS\n\n7. I believe Olivia's best interests are served by maintaining the current arrangement with me as her primary caregiver. I am seeking the following:\n\n   (a) An order that Olivia's primary residence be with me;\n\n   (b) David to have parenting time every other weekend from Friday at 5:00 p.m. to Sunday at 5:00 p.m., and one evening per week;\n\n   (c) A gradual increase in David's parenting time over the next 12 months as Olivia adjusts, with a review at that time;\n\n   (d) That David provide his work schedule to me at least 14 days in advance so that parenting time can be arranged accordingly.\n\nCHILD SUPPORT\n\n8. David's annual income is approximately $125,000 based on his 2023 tax return. I am seeking child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines.\n\n9. My current annual income is $38,000 from my part-time position as a dental hygienist.\n\nURGENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\n10. On October 28, 2024, David sent me a text message stating that he plans to keep Olivia for \"as long as I want\" during his next scheduled parenting time. A copy of this text message is attached as Exhibit \"C\".\n\n11. I am concerned that David may attempt to retain Olivia beyond his scheduled parenting time. I am seeking an interim order to prevent this.\n\nSWORN BEFORE ME at Kelowna,\nBritish Columbia, on November 2, 2024\n\n_________________________\nA Commissioner for Taking Affidavits\nfor British Columbia\n\n_________________________\nREBECCA FOSTER",

      "content": "PROVINCIAL COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nFAMILY COURT\n\nBETWEEN:\nMARCUS WILLIAMS\nApplicant\nAND:\nJENNIFER THOMPSON\nRespondent\n\nBefore: Judge K. Sandhu\nDate: August 22, 2024\nFile No: FN-19-4523\nRegistry: New Westminster\n\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT AND ORDER\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] The Applicant, Marcus Williams, seeks to vary a child support order dated March 15, 2021. He claims a material change in circumstances due to job loss and subsequent re-employment at a lower income.\n\n[2] The Respondent, Jennifer Thompson, opposes the variation and seeks retroactive child support for alleged underpayment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[3] The parties separated in January 2021. They have two children: Jayden, born 2014, and Maya, born 2017.\n\n[4] The March 2021 order required Mr. Williams to pay child support of $1,650 per month based on his then-income of $98,000 annually.\n\n[5] Mr. Williams was laid off from his position as an IT manager in February 2023. He received severance of $45,000. He was unemployed for 8 months before finding new employment as a technical support specialist at an annual salary of $62,000.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nMaterial Change in Circumstances\n\n[6] Under section 152 of the Family Law Act, a court may vary a child support order if there has been a change in circumstances since the order was made.\n\n[7] I find that Mr. Williams' job loss and re-employment at a significantly lower salary constitutes a material change in circumstances. His income has decreased by approximately 37%.\n\n[8] However, I must also consider whether this change was voluntary or involuntary. Based on the evidence, including the Record of Employment attached as Exhibit 3, I find that Mr. Williams' layoff was involuntary and resulted from company downsizing.\n\n[9] Ms. Thompson argues that Mr. Williams is intentionally underemployed. She points to his qualifications and previous salary. However, Mr. Williams has provided evidence of 47 job applications submitted between March and October 2023. I find that he made reasonable efforts to find comparable employment.\n\nIncome Determination\n\n[10] Mr. Williams' current T4 and pay stubs show an annual income of $62,000. I am satisfied this represents his actual income.\n\n[11] Regarding the $45,000 severance payment, I find that this was a one-time payment that should be prorated over a reasonable period. Given the 8-month unemployment period, I will add $5,625 per month to his income for those months.\n\n[12] For the period October 2023 onwards, I accept Mr. Williams' income as $62,000 annually.\n\nRetroactive Support\n\n[13] Ms. Thompson seeks retroactive support claiming Mr. Williams underpaid by approximately $200 per month from January 2022 to February 2023 when his income exceeded $98,000.\n\n[14] She has provided copies of Mr. Williams' 2021 and 2022 tax returns showing income of $104,000 and $108,000 respectively.\n\n[15] Applying the Guidelines table amount, child support should have been $1,740 per month at $104,000 income and $1,810 per month at $108,000 income.\n\n[16] I find that Mr. Williams underpaid by:\n    - 2022: ($1,740 - $1,650) \u00d7 12 = $1,080\n    - January-February 2023: ($1,810 - $1,650) \u00d7 2 = $320\n    - Total retroactive amount: $1,400\n\nORDER\n\n[17] THIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\n\n1. The child support order dated March 15, 2021 is varied effective October 1, 2023.\n\n2. Commencing October 1, 2023, Mr. Williams shall pay child support to Ms. Thompson in the amount of $982 per month for the two children, based on his annual income of $62,000.\n\n3. Mr. Williams shall pay retroactive child support of $1,400 to Ms. Thompson within 60 days of this order.\n\n4. The parties shall exchange income tax returns and notices of assessment by June 15 of each year.\n\n5. Either party may apply to vary this order upon a material change in circumstances.\n\n6. No order as to costs.\n\n_______________________\nJudge K. Sandhu\nProvincial Court of British Columbia",
