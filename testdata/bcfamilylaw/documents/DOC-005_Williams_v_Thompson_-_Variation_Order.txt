PROVINCIAL COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA
FAMILY COURT

BETWEEN:
MARCUS WILLIAMS
Applicant
AND:
JENNIFER THOMPSON
Respondent

Before: Judge K. Sandhu
Date: August 22, 2024
File No: FN-19-4523
Registry: New Westminster

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT AND ORDER

INTRODUCTION

[1] The Applicant, Marcus Williams, seeks to vary a child support order dated March 15, 2021. He claims a material change in circumstances due to job loss and subsequent re-employment at a lower income.

[2] The Respondent, Jennifer Thompson, opposes the variation and seeks retroactive child support for alleged underpayment.

BACKGROUND

[3] The parties separated in January 2021. They have two children: Jayden, born 2014, and Maya, born 2017.

[4] The March 2021 order required Mr. Williams to pay child support of $1,650 per month based on his then-income of $98,000 annually.

[5] Mr. Williams was laid off from his position as an IT manager in February 2023. He received severance of $45,000. He was unemployed for 8 months before finding new employment as a technical support specialist at an annual salary of $62,000.

ANALYSIS

Material Change in Circumstances

[6] Under section 152 of the Family Law Act, a court may vary a child support order if there has been a change in circumstances since the order was made.

[7] I find that Mr. Williams' job loss and re-employment at a significantly lower salary constitutes a material change in circumstances. His income has decreased by approximately 37%.

[8] However, I must also consider whether this change was voluntary or involuntary. Based on the evidence, including the Record of Employment attached as Exhibit 3, I find that Mr. Williams' layoff was involuntary and resulted from company downsizing.

[9] Ms. Thompson argues that Mr. Williams is intentionally underemployed. She points to his qualifications and previous salary. However, Mr. Williams has provided evidence of 47 job applications submitted between March and October 2023. I find that he made reasonable efforts to find comparable employment.

Income Determination

[10] Mr. Williams' current T4 and pay stubs show an annual income of $62,000. I am satisfied this represents his actual income.

[11] Regarding the $45,000 severance payment, I find that this was a one-time payment that should be prorated over a reasonable period. Given the 8-month unemployment period, I will add $5,625 per month to his income for those months.

[12] For the period October 2023 onwards, I accept Mr. Williams' income as $62,000 annually.

Retroactive Support

[13] Ms. Thompson seeks retroactive support claiming Mr. Williams underpaid by approximately $200 per month from January 2022 to February 2023 when his income exceeded $98,000.

[14] She has provided copies of Mr. Williams' 2021 and 2022 tax returns showing income of $104,000 and $108,000 respectively.

[15] Applying the Guidelines table amount, child support should have been $1,740 per month at $104,000 income and $1,810 per month at $108,000 income.

[16] I find that Mr. Williams underpaid by:
    - 2022: ($1,740 - $1,650) × 12 = $1,080
    - January-February 2023: ($1,810 - $1,650) × 2 = $320
    - Total retroactive amount: $1,400

ORDER

[17] THIS COURT ORDERS THAT:

1. The child support order dated March 15, 2021 is varied effective October 1, 2023.

2. Commencing October 1, 2023, Mr. Williams shall pay child support to Ms. Thompson in the amount of $982 per month for the two children, based on his annual income of $62,000.

3. Mr. Williams shall pay retroactive child support of $1,400 to Ms. Thompson within 60 days of this order.

4. The parties shall exchange income tax returns and notices of assessment by June 15 of each year.

5. Either party may apply to vary this order upon a material change in circumstances.

6. No order as to costs.
