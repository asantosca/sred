Subject: Request for Explanation

James,

I am shocked and confused by yesterday's termination. I received an "Exceeds Expectations" performance review just 6 months ago and a salary increase in August.

You mentioned "organizational restructuring" but provided no details. My position still exists - I saw the job posting on LinkedIn this morning seeking a "Director of Client Relations" with identical responsibilities.

I am requesting:
1. A detailed written explanation for my termination
2. Information about any severance package beyond statutory minimums
3. A letter of reference

After 5+ years of excellent service, I deserve better than a 5-minute meeting and two weeks' notice.

I would appreciate a response by September 20, 2023.

Patricia Wong

Dear Patricia:

In response to your email of September 16, the company is under no obligation to provide reasons for termination. Your employment was terminated for legitimate business reasons.

You received all compensation required under the Employment Standards Act. The company does not owe you any additional severance.

Regarding a reference letter, we can only confirm dates of employment and position title.

The job posting you referenced is for a different role with different requirements and reports to a different supervisor.

Please direct any further inquiries to our legal counsel.

James Park
CEO

Subject: Potential Wrongful Dismissal Claim

Mr. Patel,

I was referred to you by a colleague regarding a potential wrongful dismissal claim. I was terminated from my position as Director of Client Services at MetroTech Solutions on September 15, 2023, with only 2 weeks' notice after 5+ years of exemplary service.

I am 47 years old, held a senior management position, and was earning $125,000 annually. I believe I am entitled to significantly more notice than what was provided.

Could we schedule a consultation to discuss my options?

Thank you,
Patricia Wong

Dear Ms. Wong,

Thank you for contacting Pacific Legal LLP. I would be pleased to meet with you to discuss your situation.

Based on your brief description, it does appear you may have a valid claim for wrongful dismissal. The notice period provided seems inadequate given your age, length of service, and seniority.

I have availability this Thursday, September 28, at 2:00 PM or Friday, September 29, at 10:00 AM. Please bring:
- Your employment offer letter
- Any employment contracts
- Performance reviews
- Termination letter
- Recent pay stubs

Looking forward to meeting with you.

Best regards,

Michael Patel, Lawyer
