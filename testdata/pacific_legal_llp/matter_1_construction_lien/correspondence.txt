Subject: URGENT - Payment Due for Invoice #8

Michael,

I'm writing regarding Invoice #8 in the amount of $875,000.00, which was submitted on September 1, 2023. Under the Builders Lien Act and our contract terms, payment was due today (September 18, 2023).

We have not received payment, and this is now 17 days past the invoice date. The project is progressing well - we've completed the exterior envelope and are finishing the interior units on schedule.

Can you please advise on the payment status? We need to pay our subtrades and suppliers this week.

Robert,

Thanks for reaching out. We're experiencing some cash flow issues related to pre-sale closings that have been delayed. Several buyers are having financing challenges due to the recent interest rate increases.

We expect to have funds available by mid-October. Can you continue working in the meantime? We really need to stay on schedule for the January completion.

Michael,

I appreciate the explanation, but we have our own obligations to meet. Our subtrades and suppliers need to be paid, and we're already carrying significant costs on this project.

Under the Builders Lien Act, non-payment gives us the right to file a lien and stop work. I don't want to go that route, but we need a firm commitment.

Can you provide:
1. A specific date when payment will be made
2. A written payment plan if full payment can't be made immediately
3. Some form of security (letter of credit, etc.)

Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Robert

Robert,

I can't give you a firm date right now. The pre-sale situation is fluid. Please keep working and we'll sort this out. You know we're good for the money - we've paid $4.5 million so far without issues.

Threatening liens isn't helping anyone.

Michael

Subject: FORMAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT - Westcoast Builders Ltd.

Dear Mr. Zhang:

We act for Westcoast Builders Ltd. in connection with the construction contract for the Pacific Ridge Condominium project at 4567 Kingsway, Burnaby.

This letter constitutes formal demand for immediate payment of the following amounts:

Invoice #8 (September 1, 2023):     $875,000.00 - NOW 39 DAYS OVERDUE
Invoice #9 (October 1, 2023):       $550,000.00 - NOW 9 DAYS OVERDUE
TOTAL AMOUNT DUE:                   $1,425,000.00

The Builders Lien Act, S.B.C. 1997, c. 45, requires payment within 17 days of invoice. You are in serious breach of both the statute and your contractual obligations.

Unless full payment is received by October 17, 2023, our client will:
1. File a Claim of Lien against the property
2. Suspend all work on the project
3. Commence legal action for breach of contract
4. Seek interest and legal costs

We trust you will take this matter seriously and remit payment immediately.

Yours truly,

Sarah Chen, Lawyer

Subject: RE: FORMAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

Ms. Chen:

We represent Pacific Ridge Developments Inc. Your client is attempting to extort payment by threatening liens. We contend that certain work is deficient and does not warrant payment until corrected.

Specifically, we have concerns about waterproofing details and window installations that may not meet BC Building Code requirements.

We are prepared to discuss a payment schedule but object to threats and ultimatums.

Mr. Kim:

Your October 15th letter is the first time any deficiency concerns have been raised. This appears to be a pretext to avoid payment obligations.

Our client's work has been inspected and approved by the City of Burnaby at each stage. If you have legitimate concerns, provide:
1. Specific deficiency descriptions
2. Supporting engineering reports
3. Building inspector comments

Our client filed a Claim of Lien on October 20, 2023, as your client failed to make payment by the deadline. Work has been suspended.

If your client wishes to resolve this matter without litigation, full payment must be made immediately.
