## PACIFIC LEGAL LLP - Matter 1: Construction Lien

### Test Scenario: Lawyer Sarah Chen reviewing Westcoast Builders case

**Q1: What is the total amount owed to my client Westcoast Builders?**

**Expected Answer:**
The total outstanding amount is $1,425,000.00, consisting of:
- Invoice #8 (dated September 1, 2023): $875,000.00
- Invoice #9 (dated October 1, 2023): $550,000.00

**Q2: What is the contract price for the Pacific Ridge project?**

**Expected Answer:**
The total contract price is $8,750,000.00 CAD. To date, the client has completed work valued at $6,425,000 and received payments of only $4,500,000, leaving a balance of $1,925,000 outstanding.

**Q3: When was payment due under the Builders Lien Act?**

**Expected Answer:**
Under the Builders Lien Act, S.B.C. 1997, c. 45, payment is due within 17 days of invoice. Invoice #8 was submitted September 1, 2023, making payment due September 18, 2023. Invoice #9 was submitted October 1, 2023, making payment due October 18, 2023.

**Q4: Did the client file a lien? When?**

**Expected Answer:**
Yes, the Plaintiff filed a Claim of Lien against the property on October 20, 2023, after the defendant failed to make payment despite the formal demand letter.

**Q5: What defenses has the defendant raised?**

**Expected Answer:**
The defendant initially claimed cash flow issues due to pre-sale closings being delayed. Later, through their lawyer David Kim, they claimed concerns about waterproofing details and window installations potentially not meeting BC Building Code requirements. However, these deficiency concerns were only raised after multiple payment demands and appear to be a pretext to avoid payment. The work has been inspected and approved by the City of Burnaby at each stage.

**Q6: What was the construction timeline?**

**Expected Answer:**
- Commencement: March 1, 2023
- Substantial Performance: January 15, 2024

## PACIFIC LEGAL LLP - Matter 2: Wrongful Dismissal

### Test Scenario: Lawyer Michael Patel reviewing Patricia Wong case

**Q7: How long was my client employed at MetroTech?**

**Expected Answer:**
Patricia Wong was employed from May 1, 2018, to September 15, 2023 - a total of 5 years and 4 months (approximately 5.4 years).

**Q8: What was her final salary and what severance was provided?**

**Expected Answer:**
Her final annual salary was $125,000 (effective August 1, 2023). MetroTech provided:
- 2 weeks' pay in lieu of notice: $4,808.00
- Accrued vacation pay: $3,500.00
- Final paycheck to September 15: $4,808.00
- Total: $13,116.00

This represents only the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act (8 weeks for 5 years of service), not reasonable common law notice.

**Q9: What was her performance history?**

**Expected Answer:**
Patricia had an excellent performance record:
- 2019: "Meets Expectations" - 3.5% raise, $9,000 bonus
- 2020: "Exceeds Expectations" - 5% raise, $12,000 bonus (120% of target)
- 2021: "Exceeds Expectations" - 5% raise, $13,000 bonus (130% of target)
- 2022: "Meets Expectations" - 4% raise, $10,000 bonus
- 2023: "Exceeds Expectations" - 5% raise + additional 5.5% mid-year adjustment, $15,000 bonus (150% of target)

Most recently (August 2023), she received an "on track" mid-year check-in with no concerns identified. She had no disciplinary record.

**Q10: What is our claim for reasonable notice?**

**Expected Answer:**
The claim seeks 12 months' reasonable notice based on:
- Age: 47 years old
- Length of service: 5 years and 4 months
- Position: Director of Client Services (senior management)
- Difficulty finding comparable employment

Damages sought: $125,000 (12 months' salary) plus $15,000 for loss of benefits and pension contributions, plus aggravated and punitive damages.

**Q11: Was there any just cause for termination?**

**Expected Answer:**
No. The termination letter cited only "organizational restructuring." Patricia's most recent performance review (April 2023) rated her as "Exceeds Expectations," and she received a mid-year salary increase in August 2023. There is no evidence of just cause. Additionally, Patricia discovered the company posted a nearly identical job ("Director of Client Relations") shortly after her termination, contradicting the restructuring claim.

## FRASER LAW CORPORATION - Matter 1: Commercial Lease Dispute

### Test Scenario: Lawyer Robert Fraser reviewing Riverside Restaurant case

**Q12: Does my client have a valid renewal option?**

**Expected Answer:**
Yes. Section 1.2 of the Commercial Lease Agreement clearly states: "The Tenant shall have the option to renew this Lease for one additional term of FIVE (5) YEARS on the same terms and conditions, except for rent which shall be at fair market value."

Section 1.3 requires written notice not less than six months prior to expiration. The client provided notice on August 15, 2023 - more than six months before the December 31, 2024 expiration date. The renewal option was properly exercised.

**Q13: What is the landlord's defense for refusing the renewal?**

**Expected Answer:**
The landlord (Delta Commercial Properties) claims they plan to redevelop the property and need vacant possession. Their lawyer, Jonathan Lee, argues that:
1. The renewal option is "not absolute" and subject to the landlord's business requirements
2. Inability to agree on fair market rent negates the option

However, these arguments are legally weak. The renewal option is an unqualified contractual right, and if parties cannot agree on rent, it can be determined through appraisal. The redevelopment plans appear to be speculative with no permits obtained.

**Q14: What has my client invested in this location?**

**Expected Answer:**
Riverside Restaurant Group invested approximately $250,000 in leasehold improvements to convert the premises into a full-service restaurant, including:
- Kitchen equipment
- Dining area renovations
- Patio construction

The restaurant "The River's Edge" opened in March 2020. All improvements become the landlord's property at the end of the lease, so forcing the client to relocate would result in complete loss of this investment.

**Q15: What damages are we claiming?**

**Expected Answer:**
The claim seeks:
1. Specific performance (order requiring landlord to honour the renewal), OR
2. Damages of $500,000 consisting of:
   - Loss of business goodwill and customer base: $200,000
   - Lost leasehold improvements: $250,000
   - Relocation costs: $50,000

Plus pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, and costs.

**Q16: What is the monthly rent and lease term?**

**Expected Answer:**
Initial term: January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024 (5 years)
Current monthly rent (Year 5, 2024): $8,118.00
Base rent started at $7,500/month in 2020 with 2% annual increases
Tenant also pays 10% share of operating costs (property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, utilities, property management)
Total premises: 3,500 square feet at 7890 King George Boulevard, Surrey

## FRASER LAW CORPORATION - Matter 2: Shareholder Dispute

### Test Scenario: Lawyer Robert Fraser reviewing David Kumar case

**Q17: What is the ownership structure of Innovate Tech?**

**Expected Answer:**
Innovate Tech Solutions Inc. has three equal shareholders, each owning 100 common shares (33.33% each):
- David Kumar (Petitioner/Client): 33.33%
- Jennifer Tam: 33.33%
- Marcus Williams: 33.33%

The company was incorporated March 1, 2019. Each shareholder contributed $50,000 in initial capital.

**Q18: What oppressive conduct has occurred?**

**Expected Answer:**
Since terminating David Kumar's employment (February 1, 2023), Tam and Williams have:

1. Excluded Kumar from all shareholder meetings and business decisions
2. Refused to provide financial statements despite his contractual right (Shareholders Agreement Section 6.1)
3. Paid themselves increased salaries/bonuses ($150,000 each) while declaring no dividends, violating Section 5.1 requiring distribution of 50% of net profits
4. Attempted to dilute Kumar's shareholding by proposing to issue new shares without his consent (requires unanimous approval per Section 2.1(a))
5. Diverted business opportunities to a new competing company they formed (TechWorks Innovations Ltd.), including the Coastal Enterprises contract
6. Refused to engage in buyout discussions

**Q19: What matters require unanimous shareholder approval?**

**Expected Answer:**
Per Section 2.1 of the Shareholders Agreement, unanimous approval is required for:
- Issuance of new shares
- Amendment of Articles
- Sale of substantially all assets
- Merger or amalgamation
- Winding up or dissolution
- Borrowing exceeding $100,000
- Capital expenditures exceeding $50,000

All other matters require only majority vote (66.67%).

**Q20: What are my client's employment termination rights?**

**Expected Answer:**
Section 4.4 of the Shareholders Agreement states: "Termination of a Shareholder's employment does not affect their share ownership."

Section 11.2 further provides: "If a Shareholder's employment is terminated without cause, they retain all shareholder rights including the right to remain as a shareholder and director."

David was terminated without cause, so he retains full shareholder rights including:
- Information rights (financial statements, board minutes)
- Voting rights on all shareholder matters
- Right to dividends
- Right to serve as a director

**Q21: What remedies are we seeking?**

**Expected Answer:**
Under Section 227 of the Business Corporations Act (oppression remedy):
1. Primary remedy: Order requiring Tam and Williams to purchase Kumar's shares at fair value (determined by independent valuator)
2. Alternative: Winding up and dissolution of the company (Section 324)
3. Restraining order preventing Tam/Williams from:
   - Declaring dividends without Kumar's consent
   - Issuing new shares without consent
   - Making major decisions without proper approval
4. Accounting of all Company finances from January 1, 2022 to present
5. Damages for breach of fiduciary duty
6. Costs

**Q22: What is the company's financial situation?**

**Expected Answer:**
According to the Petition, Innovate Tech has been profitable since 2021:
- Annual revenue: Approximately $800,000
- Annual net profits: Approximately $200,000

Under Section 5.1 of the Shareholders Agreement, at least 50% of net profits ($100,000) should be distributed as dividends. Instead, Tam and Williams have paid themselves increased salaries and bonuses totaling $150,000 each while declaring no dividends, effectively excluding Kumar from the company's profits.
