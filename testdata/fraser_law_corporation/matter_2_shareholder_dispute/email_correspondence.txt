Jennifer,

Can you give me more details about what "changes" you're considering? Is this about the new product line we discussed last quarter?

I can meet tomorrow but would appreciate an agenda so I can prepare properly.

David,

We're very busy right now. We'll get you information when we have time.

Regarding a buyout - we're not interested in buying your shares at this time. You're welcome to try to sell them to a third party if you can find a buyer (good luck with that).

Subject: URGENT - Shareholders Agreement Violations

Jennifer and Marcus,

I am writing to formally object to several apparent violations of our Shareholders Agreement:

1. INFORMATION RIGHTS: I still have not received the financial statements I requested on February 10. This violates Section 6.1.

2. DIVIDENDS: The company was profitable in 2022 (approximately $200K net profit based on what I know). Under Section 5.1, at least 50% should be distributed as dividends. Have dividends been declared? If not, why not?

3. SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS: Have any shareholder meetings been held since my termination? I should have been notified.

4. My employment termination does not affect my shareholder rights. Per Section 4.4, I remain a shareholder with full rights.

Please provide a complete response by March 8, 2023, or I will have no choice but to seek legal advice.

Subject: Proposed Share Issuance - OBJECTION

I just learned from a mutual contact that you are planning to issue new shares to yourselves.

Under Section 2.1(a) of the Shareholders Agreement, issuance of new shares requires UNANIMOUS shareholder approval.

I do NOT consent to any share issuance. Any shares issued without my consent would violate the Shareholders Agreement and the Business Corporations Act.

This appears to be a blatant attempt to dilute my shareholding. I strongly object.

Subject: RE: Share Issuance

David,

We haven't issued any shares yet. We're exploring our options.

The company needs capital to grow. Jennifer and I are willing to invest more. If you want to participate pro rata, let us know. Otherwise, don't complain about dilution.

Subject: Discovery of TechWorks Innovations Ltd.

I recently discovered that you both have formed a new company called "TechWorks Innovations Ltd." which appears to be doing business in the exact same field as Innovate Tech.

Specifically, I learned that you diverted a major contract with Coastal Enterprises (which was originally pitched to Innovate Tech) to TechWorks instead.

This appears to be a clear conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty. You are diverting business opportunities away from Innovate Tech (in which I am a 33% shareholder) to your new company (in which I have no interest).

I demand:
1. Full disclosure of TechWorks Innovations' business activities
2. Transfer of the Coastal Enterprises contract to Innovate Tech
3. An accounting of any other diverted opportunities
4. Immediate buyout of my shares at fair value

This is my final attempt to resolve this amicably. If I don't receive a satisfactory response by June 30, I will be retaining legal counsel.

David,

What we do outside of Innovate Tech is our business. TechWorks is pursuing different opportunities in a different market segment.

We're done discussing this with you. Do what you need to do.

Subject: Shareholder Oppression Case

Mr. Fraser,

I need legal representation for a shareholder dispute involving my 33% ownership in Innovate Tech Solutions Inc.

My former business partners have:
- Terminated my employment without cause
- Excluded me from all company information and decisions
- Refused to pay dividends while paying themselves excessive salaries
- Attempted to dilute my shares
- Diverted business to a competing company they formed
- Refused all buyout discussions

I believe this constitutes oppression under the Business Corporations Act.

Can we meet to discuss my options? I have extensive documentation.

Thank you,
David Kumar
