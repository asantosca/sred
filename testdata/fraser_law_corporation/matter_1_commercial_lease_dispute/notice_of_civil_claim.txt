NOTICE OF CIVIL CLAIM

CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF

Part 1: STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. The Plaintiff, Riverside Restaurant Group Ltd., is a company incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and operates restaurants in the Lower Mainland.

2. The Defendant, Delta Commercial Properties Inc., is a company incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and owns and manages commercial real estate in Surrey, British Columbia.

3. On January 1, 2020, the Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Commercial Lease Agreement ("Lease") for premises located at Unit 150, 7890 King George Boulevard, Surrey, BC ("Premises").

4. The Premises consist of approximately 3,500 square feet of restaurant space in a mixed-use commercial building.

5. The Lease term was for five years commencing January 1, 2020, and expiring December 31, 2024, with an option to renew for an additional five years.

6. The base rent was $7,500 per month plus operating costs, with annual increases of 2%.

7. The Plaintiff invested approximately $250,000 in leasehold improvements to convert the Premises into a full-service restaurant, including kitchen equipment, dining area renovations, and patio construction.

8. The Plaintiff's restaurant, "The River's Edge," opened for business in March 2020.

9. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, the parties negotiated temporary rent reductions, which the Plaintiff honoured and later repaid in full.

10. In July 2023, the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that it intended to redevelop the property and would not be renewing any leases.

11. On September 1, 2023, the Defendant served the Plaintiff with a Notice to Vacate, demanding that the Plaintiff vacate the Premises by December 31, 2023.

12. The Lease clearly provides that the Plaintiff has an option to renew for an additional five-year term, which the Plaintiff exercised by written notice on August 15, 2023.

13. The Defendant has refused to honor the renewal option and insists the Plaintiff must vacate.

14. The Defendant's redevelopment plans are speculative and no permits have been obtained.

15. If forced to relocate, the Plaintiff will lose its established customer base, forfeit its leasehold improvements, and incur substantial costs to relocate and establish a new location.

    - Relocation costs ($50,000)

(e) Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest;
