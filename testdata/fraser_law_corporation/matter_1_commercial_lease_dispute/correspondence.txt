Subject: RE: Lease Renewal - Unit 150

Maria,

Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we will not be able to offer a lease renewal for Unit 150.

Delta Commercial Properties has decided to redevelop the property at 7890 King George Boulevard. We are planning a major renovation and reconfiguration of the commercial spaces.

As a result, we require vacant possession of all units by December 31, 2024. Please consider this email as formal notice that your tenancy will not be renewed and you must vacate the premises by the end of your current lease term.

We appreciate your tenancy and wish you well in finding a new location.

Best regards,

Thomas Chen
President
Delta Commercial Properties Inc.

Subject: RE: Lease Renewal - Renewal Option is Contractual Right

Thomas,

I am confused by your response. Our Lease clearly provides us with an option to renew for an additional five-year term. This is not a request - it is a contractual right that we have properly exercised.

Section 1.2 of the Lease states: "The Tenant shall have the option to renew this Lease for one additional term of FIVE (5) YEARS on the same terms and conditions..."

We provided notice more than six months in advance as required. You cannot simply refuse to honor this contractual provision.

Your redevelopment plans do not override our lease rights. We have invested $250,000 in this location and built a successful business over the past 3.5 years.

Please reconsider your position and prepare the renewal lease as required under our agreement.

Subject: Lease Renewal - Final Position

Ms. Rodriguez:

We represent Delta Commercial Properties Inc. in this matter.

Our client's position is that the redevelopment plans constitute a legitimate business reason to decline lease renewals. The renewal option is not absolute and is subject to the landlord's business requirements.

Furthermore, the renewal requires agreement on "fair market rent." Our client is not obligated to reach such an agreement.

Your lease expires December 31, 2024. Please make appropriate arrangements to vacate the premises by that date.

Any further correspondence should be directed to this office.

Regards,

Jonathan Lee, Lawyer
Delta Commercial Properties Inc.

Subject: Urgent - Landlord Refusing to Honor Lease Renewal

Mr. Fraser,

I was referred to you by a business colleague regarding a commercial lease dispute.

We operate a successful restaurant and have a five-year lease with a clear renewal option. We properly exercised the option six months in advance, but the landlord is refusing to honor it, citing vague "redevelopment plans."

We've invested $250,000 in this location and have built strong customer loyalty. Being forced to relocate would be devastating to our business.

Can we meet this week to discuss our options? I have attached copies of the lease and recent correspondence.

Thank you,
Maria Rodriguez

Subject: FORMAL DEMAND - Honour Lease Renewal Option

Dear Mr. Lee:

We act for Riverside Restaurant Group Ltd. ("Riverside") in connection with the commercial lease at Unit 150, 7890 King George Boulevard, Surrey.

This letter constitutes formal demand that your client honour the lease renewal option that was properly exercised by our client on August 15, 2023.

Section 1.2 of the Lease grants Riverside an unqualified right to renew for five years, subject only to providing six months' notice. Our client complied with this requirement.

Your assertion that the renewal is "not absolute" is incorrect. The renewal option is a contractual right that cannot be unilaterally revoked based on speculative redevelopment plans.

Your suggestion that inability to agree on rent negates the option is also without merit. If the parties cannot agree, fair market rent can be determined through appraisal or other dispute resolution mechanisms.

DEMAND:
1. Prepare and execute a renewal lease agreement for the period January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2029
2. Provide this document by October 16, 2023
3. Engage in good faith negotiations regarding fair market rent

If your client fails to comply, we will commence legal proceedings seeking specific performance and/or substantial damages, including loss of business goodwill, leasehold improvements, and relocation costs.

Yours truly,

Robert Fraser, Lawyer

Subject: RE: FORMAL DEMAND

Mr. Fraser:

Your client's interpretation of the renewal option is not supported by commercial leasing practices. Renewal options are always subject to the landlord's reasonable business requirements.

Our client has legitimate plans to redevelop the property and is not obligated to enter into long-term lease commitments that would interfere with those plans.

We will not be preparing a renewal lease. Your client should focus on finding alternative premises.
