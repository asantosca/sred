Review the codebase and update CLAUDE.md with current, accurate information.

Steps:
1. Explore the codebase structure (directories, key files, dependencies)
2. Check for new or removed features, endpoints, services, or models
3. Verify environment variables and configuration are accurate
4. Update the "Current Phase" section based on docs/ROADMAP.md
5. Ensure architecture notes reflect current patterns
6. Keep the file concise but comprehensive

Do NOT change:
- Commit Message Rules section
- Project description/branding

Focus on technical accuracy. Remove outdated information, add new features, and ensure someone new to the project could understand the system from this file alone.
