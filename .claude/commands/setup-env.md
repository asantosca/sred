description: Set up environment variables and configuration
---

Help set up environment configuration:

1. Check for existing .env files in backend and frontend
2. List required environment variables based on config.py
3. Create template .env files if they don't exist
4. Provide guidance on what values are needed (API keys, database URLs, etc.)
5. Warn about missing critical configuration
