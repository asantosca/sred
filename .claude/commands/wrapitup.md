Please perform the following tasks in order:

1. **Review Current Progress**:
   - Check the git status to see what has changed
   - Review recent commits to understand what was accomplished
   - Look at the current state of the codebase

2. **Update the Roadmap**:
   - Read the ROADMAP.md file
   - Identify which milestones and tasks have been completed based on recent work
   - Update the roadmap by:
     - Moving completed items from "In Progress" to "Completed"
     - Updating progress percentages
     - Adding any new tasks discovered during implementation
     - Updating status descriptions

3. **Clean Up**:
   - Remove any temporary files (*.pyc, __pycache__, .DS_Store, etc.)
   - Check for and remove any debugging code or commented-out code that's no longer needed
   - Ensure all files follow the project's formatting standards

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - Stage all relevant changes (updated roadmap, code changes, new migrations, etc.)
   - Create a descriptive commit message summarizing the progress
   - Push to the remote repository

IMPORTANT:
- Ask for confirmation before pushing to the remote repository
- Provide a summary of what was accomplished and what was updated in the roadmap
- Use clean, single-line commit messages (no Claude attribution as per CLAUDE.md)
